Access to data is often provided through application programming interfaces (APIs), whether internal or external to the organization.

        "The National Basketball Association is the main basketball league in the United States of America. It currently features 30 teams from different cities, divided in 2 conferences (East and West) of 15 teams. Each team plays a total of 82 games during the regular season. After that, the 8 teams with better records from each conference are seeded in a playoff format, with the winner of each conference playing the finals to determine the eventual champion. NBA seasons usually play out between october of one year, to june of the next year, so for example the current season being played is called the 2021/2022 season.\n",

Games are played to 48 minutes, so the total amount of minutes of combined play time for any team in a single game with no added time is 240 minutes. If the score is tied at the end of the 48 minutes, 5 minutes of extra time are played, this continues until a winner is decided.\n",
